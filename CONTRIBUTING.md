# Contributing to types-doodler

Do you any utility in mind? Go ahead and create a PR with the necessary code and I'll check it out.

## Setting Up a Local Copy

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/enbermudez/types-doodler.git`

2. Run `yarn` in the root `types-doodler` folder.

Once it is done, you can modify any existing helper or create a new one.

## Testing

Every helper must be fuly tested. You can create a test on `tests/type/helper-name` and run tests by using `yarn test`.
